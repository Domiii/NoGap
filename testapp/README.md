Components Test App
=============

This `Test App` uses Angular + Bootstrap + Font-Awsome + `components` for a simple single-page web application.
More complex examples will pop up on Github, hopefully soon.

This app showcases some of the major features of the `components` framework, including:

* Simplicity
  * Client + Host parts of the application can be developed in unison, without having to define a complex protocol or packet routing.
* Host<->Client RPC
  * You can directly call methods, with arguments, on the other side.
  * But don't worry. It is also secure. The client side does not get to see any of the host code.
  * At the same time, the stack traces generated by client components 100% accurately report the correct line number and filename of definition (if not disabled).
* Dynamic loading of client-side code
  * The client will only install the components that you want it to and when you want it to.
* Basic asset management
  * You can easily get access to the contents of, or automatically include, files from the local or a designated public folder, by just naming an asset, and without having to worry about the security of other files outside the public folder.
